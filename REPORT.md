### Introduction
- Team: 
  - Chengzhuo Xiong (CHX53) 
  - Yutong Tang (YUT89) 
  - Shiyuan Luo (SHL298) 
  - Sizhe Fu (SIF33) 
- The e-commerce website is built with the MERN stack, which includes MongoDB, ExpressJS, React, and NodeJS. 
- It is designed to be a general online shopping website that includes several different categories of products, such as accessories, desktops, laptops, phones, tablets, watches, vehicles, clothes, toys, and decorations.
- Guests can browse the products and select the ones they want to purchase. They can also register as users to add products to their shopping cart and complete the checkout process. Administrators have access to manage all the products and users on the website.
- Overall, the e-commerce website provides a user-friendly experience for shoppers to easily find and purchase products, while also providing administrators with the necessary tools to manage the website's content and users.

### Technical Architecture 
- Models: Use Mongoose to define the schema for the data and provide an interface for working with MongoDB.
- Views: Use React components to define the visual elements of our application and handle user interaction. Use React Router DOM to define the structure of the application and handle navigation. Use Tabler Icons React and Mantine UI to add visual elements to the application.
- Controllers: Use Express to define routes and middleware functions to handle requests and interact with the Model and View layers. Use Axios to make HTTP requests from the client to the server. Use CORS to enable communication between the client and server. Use Date-fns to format dates and times for display to the user. Use Web Vitals to monitor and optimize the performance of the application.

### Challenges 
- Implementing secure password storage and user authentication can be complex and time-consuming. 
- Balancing different functionality for general users and administrators can require careful planning and organization to ensure that each group of users has access to the appropriate features and information.
- Unifying styles across different pages can be challenging, especially when working with a large and complex application. 
- Providing a user-friendly experience can require significant attention to detail and user testing to identify and address usability issues.
- Integrating with the back-end can be complex, especially if when working with multiple technologies and libraries. We have needed to troubleshoot issues related to API calls, data formatting, and data validation.

### Future Work 
1. User reviews and ratings: Allow users to leave reviews and ratings for products, which can help other users make informed purchase decisions.
2. Wishlist: Allow users to save products they are interested in for future reference.
3. Social media integration: Allow users to share products on social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram.
4. Order tracking: Provide users with the ability to track the status of their orders.
5. Payment: Allow users to pay after they submit the order.
6. Technologies to learn: Payment Gateways, Server-Side Rendering (SSR), Content Delivery Network (CDN)


### Conclusion 
- In this course, we have learnt a board range of web technologies and standard, including HTML,
CSS, JavaScript, AJAX, Bootstrap, Front-end Frameworks, Back-end Frameworks, RESTful API, and 
MongoDB. These elements are important concepts and components of full-stack development. Therefore this course fits well with our career development aspirations. 

- From our perspective, it would have been nice if the class could have covered in depth a complete full-stack development process (e.g. MERN or MEAN, etc.) involving everything from project design to deployment to remote servers.
